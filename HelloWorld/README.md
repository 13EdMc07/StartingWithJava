# HelloWorld Project. 
This is a project to get you started in java.  The class included above is a sample program with a breakdown in the comments about how each line breaks down.  

To compile this class make sure that the terminal is in the correct directory.  You can check this quickly by using the pwd command.  The path should end with HelloWorld.  
If it ends with anything else use cd (as explained in the README for this repo) to get to the correct location. 


## Compiling HelloWorld project 
Once you are in the HelloWorld directory you can compile the project with: 
``` 
javac HelloWorld.java
``` 
and you can run the program with: 
```
java HelloWorld  
```

## The task
The project outlined here is to change this code so that the method printHelloWorld prints "HelloWorld" when the number
given is even and "not this time sucker" when the number is odd. 
When the whole program is run it should print out: 
``` 
Hello World
not this time sucker 
```
