# StartingWithJava

To do anything in this repo open your terminal.  First choose where you want to clone the repo to.  I typically chose to create a coding directory within Documents directory.  
I'll put directions on how to do that below but its up to you.  These instructions assume you are starting from the home directory. This also assumes you have git installed.  

## Cloning the repo to Documents/coding
First you need to change directory to Documents.  
```
cd Documents
```
Then create the coding directory and change to that directory: 
```
mkdir coding
cd coding 
```
Next you need to clone the repo.  
```
git clone git@github.com:spanut01/StartingWithJava.git
```
Now move into the newly created directory with: 
``` 
cd StartingWithJava
``` 
And you can get started!
